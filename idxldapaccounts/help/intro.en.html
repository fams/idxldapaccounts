<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>
<b>Idxldapaccounts</b> is a Webmin module that allow listing, search, creation and 
edition of LDAP users accounts and groups and some system interactions like 
creating or destroying users home directories.
<p>
This module is first aimed at SAMBA-LDAP PDC administration, that is, Unix 
servers using Samba and OpenLDAP to replace Windows NT4 servers as Primary 
Domain Controller using LDAP as a technical directory to store users and 
groups.
<p>
By a LDAP user we mean a LDAP belonging to the following objectclasses:
<ul>
<li> inetOrgPerson
<li>posixAccount
</ul>
and who can have many other objectclasses corresponding to technical accounts
like :
<li>sambaAccount
<li>shadowAccount
<li>...
</ul>
By a LDAP group we mean an LDAP entry belonging to the following objectclasses:
<ul>
<li>posixGroup
</ul>
<p>
Note that whereas the LDAP server can be different from the machine where 
Webmin runs, the Samba server, where real accounts lives MUST be the machine 
which runs Webmin.
<p>


<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<p>
Current version allows:
<ul>
<li>users listing, search, edition, creation, deletion (with implicit file system interaction for users home directories operations)
<li>user groups listing with in place addition and deletion
<li>disable user account facility
<li>groups listing, search, edition, creation, deletion
<li>group members listing with in place addition or deletion
<li>order lists by attribute
<li>most parameters used by the application are configurable from the Webmin interface
</ul>
<p>

<h2>How do I Begin</h2>
<p>
To begin with <b>Idxldapaccounts</b>, you LDAP parameters must be properly configured, this can be done online by clicking on the "Module config" link at the top of the screen, so please consult the LDAP server administrator or check you LDAP configuration before beginning.
