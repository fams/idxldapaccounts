<header>Accounts screen</header>

<p>
The main accounts screens shows the list of optional accounts that may be administered using
the Idxldapaccounts Webmin module.
<p>
<h2>Enabling/disabling accounts</h2>
<p>
You may enable or disable an account by selecting/unselecting the check button for this account under the "Enabled" column.
<p>
When an account is enabled, a corresponding link appears in the user edition screen for each user and this link can be used to access this account parameters for the user (you can then create, delete or modify this account for the given user). When the account is disabled, you cannot see users parameters belonging to this account in the individual user edition screen.
<p>

<h2>Editing accounts</h2>
<p>
By clicking on the account name in the first column of the list, you access the account edition
screen which has its own help screen.
<p>

<h2>Saving configuration</H2>
<p>
At the bottom of the screen, the "Apply" button valids your changes on the screen by saviing this configuration to a file, note that this configuration isn't taken into account unless you save it and that when it is saved, it will be used in all futur sessions (until you change the configuration again).
<p>
If the configuration is saved without error, a success message appears on the screen.
