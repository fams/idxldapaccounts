<header>Groups screen</header>

<p>
The main groups screen presents you with a search form, add and delete buttons and groups listing.
<p>

<h2>Display options</h2>
<p>
By default, groups are ordered by cn, (called "name" through the interface), but you can
change this by clicking on column headers that allow it (like the "Group number" header).
<p>
When no search parameter is given (that is when first arriving to this screen or when clicking
on the "Show complete list button"), the maximum number of groups is displayed, this number is
specified in the module configuration as the "maximum number of results displayed by a LDAP search" parameter.
<p>
If the number of groups to be displayd exceeds the "maximum number of list items displayed per page" configuration parameter, results are displayed on multiple pages with a menu allowing direct access to each page.
<p>


<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
The search form allow to filter groups based on the attribute specified in the "search by" select box.
<p>
On non numeric attributes, you can use LDAP wildcards in the search text box.
<p>
Search is always performed under the LDAP Organizational Unit specified by the "LDAP groups search base" configuration parameter, but you can restrict it to a sub OU by selecting it in the OU tree displayed at the left of the search form.
<p>
When a search result is displayed, you may return to the full groups listing by clicking on
the "Show complete list" button that will then appear under the search form.
<p>

<h2>Adding groups</h2>

<h2>Editing groups</h2>
