<header>Users screen</header>

<p>
The main users screen presents you with a search form, add and delete buttons and users listing.
<p>

<h2>Display options</h2>
<p>
By default, users are ordered by uid, (called "name" through the interface), but you can
change this by clicking on column headers that allow it (like the "Number" header).
<p>
When no search parameter is given (that is when first arriving to this screen or when clicking
on the "Show complete list button"), the maximum number of users is displayed, this number is
specified in the module configuration as the "maximum number of results displayed by a LDAP search" parameter.
<p>
If the number of users to be displayd exceeds the "maximum number of list items displayed per page" configuration parameter, results are displayed on multiple pages with a menu allowing direct access to each page.
<p>
Finally, if the "hide disabled users" configuration parameter is set, only users with enabled account will appear in the list. If this parameter is set to "no", a "Status" column will say if a user account is disabled.
<p>


<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
The search form allow to filter users based on the attribute specified in the "search by" select box.
<p>
On non numeric attributes, you can use LDAP wildcards in the search text box.
<p>
Search is always performed under the LDAP Organizational Unit specified by the "LDAP users search base" configuration parameter, but you can restrict it to a sub OU by selecting it in the OU tree displayed at the left of the search form.
<p>
When a search result is displayed, you may return to the full users listing by clicking on
the "Show complete list" button that will then appear under the search form.
<p>

<h2>Adding users</h2> 
<p>
Under the search form, you will find a "Add user" button which leads you to the user creation form. A specific help screen is accessible from this screen.
<p>

<h2>Editing users</h2>
<p>
The first column of the users listing displays users uid as links, when clicking on such a link, you will go to the edition screen for the corresponding user where you may modify his parameters. A specific help screen is accessible from this screen.
<p>

<h2>Deleting users</h2>
<p>
The last column of the users listing provides a "delete" button for each user, when clicking on it, you will go to a confirmation page for completly removing the corresponding user from LDAP.
<p>
