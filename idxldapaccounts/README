# This is README file for Idxldapaccounts 0.2
# $Id$

PRESENTATION
============

Idxldapaccounts is a Webmin module that allow listing, search, creation and 
edition of LDAP users accounts and groups and some system interactions like 
creating or destroying users home directories.
This module is first aimed at SAMBA-LDAP PDC administration, that is, Unix 
servers using Samba and OpenLDAP to replace Windows NT4 servers as Primary 
Domain Controller using LDAP as a technical directory to store users and 
groups. But it can be used to manage any LDAP driven account like mail,
instant messaging or PKI by only adding a corresponding CGI program and 
little configuration modification.

By a LDAP user we mean a LDAP entry belonging to the following objectclasses:
	- inetOrgPerson
	- posixAccount
and who can have many other objectclasses corresponding to technical accounts
like :
	- sambaAccount
	- shadowAccount
	- ...

By a LDAP group we mean an LDAP entry belonging to the following objectclasses:
	- posixGroup

Note that whereas the LDAP server can be different from the machine where 
Webmin runs, the Samba server, where real accounts lives MUST be the machine 
which runs Webmin.

PLATEFORM
=========

This version has only a Redhat 7.2 configuration file but should work with no 
effort on most Linux and OpenBSD systems.
This module should work with Webmin >=0.92.
The module has only been tested with OpenLDAP-2.0.21-8, the LDAP server must 
include the samba.schema schema.

============

Idxldapaccounts depends on the following softwares:
	- Perl module perl-ldap >=0.25.
