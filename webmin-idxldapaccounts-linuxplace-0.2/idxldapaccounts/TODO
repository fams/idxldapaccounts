# BUGs and ENHencements

* [ENH-295]: internationalisation
	Internationalisation framework is done but now the module requires more langages 
	for dictionary and online help (only english is supported at the moment).
* [ENH-333]: write code for new account types
	Module has been redisigned to accept generic account type management, providing
	one adds a dedicated "edit_accounttype.cgi" file to handle it and little
	configuration. At the moment, only Samba accounts are handled, more account
	types should be added like mail accounts.
