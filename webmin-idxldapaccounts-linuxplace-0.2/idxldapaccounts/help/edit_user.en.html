<header>Edit user screen</header>

<p>
This screen allows you to access various forms for modifying user's main parameters and optional accounts.
<p>
<p>
The first three options of the menu remain permanently while subsequents depends on the accounts that can be (are configured to be) administered by the module. This help only discribes these three entries, each optional account help screen being left to be written by individual account configuration code writters. 
<p>

<h2>Optional accounts menu entries</h2>
<p>
When optional accounts entries appear in the menu, they may have two states: if they are written using normal text, it means that the user has no such account and clicking on the link will lead you to a creation form for this account, if bold text is used, the user has an already configured account and the link will show you specific parameters for this account that you may modify. 
<p>
<h2>Common features</h2>
<p>
Two elements are common to the three screens namely:
<ul>
<li><b>delete user</b> button:
<p>
When clicking on it, you will go to a confirmation page for completly removing the corresponding user from LDAP.
<p>
<li><b>Apply changes</b> button:
<p>
This button located at the bottom of the screen allow you to commit the changes you made on the screen, if you made changes on a screen and live it without applying them, your modification are lost.
<p>
Once you applied your changes and if no error occured, the same screen is redisplyed with the new updated parameters (no success message appears).
<p>
If an error occured during the modification process, an error screen is displayed and you may redisplay the screen by clicking on the "Back" button of you browser and then correct errors (if these where only parameters errors).
<p>
<h2>General Parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Organization:</b>

<p>
<li><b>Retype password:</b>
<p>
Enter the password again if you want to modify it, both values will be compared to be sure you really typed what you wanted to, which is not so easy to verify yourself as passwords are not displayed as you type them.
<p>

<p>
<li><b>account is enabled</b> check button
<p>
You may enable (resp. disable) the user account by seleting (deselecting) this check button. User account is disabled by placing a leading "!" in his password (so this technique isn't very efficient with clear passwords).
</ul>
