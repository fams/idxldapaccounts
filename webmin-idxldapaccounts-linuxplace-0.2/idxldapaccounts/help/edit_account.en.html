<header>Edit account screen</header>

<p>
This screen allow you to configure for each account parameter the fact that the parameter will be visible or editable in the user account edition screen, and the default value for this parameter (used when you create a specific user account.
<p>
This screen is mostly self explanatory and you may refeer to the specific user account edition screen help for more details on specific account parameters.
<p>
Some parameters cannot be configured as editable nor theyr default value can be changed, this is the case if the parameter has a leading "*" in the accounts configuration file ("accounts.conf" or "default_accounts.conf"). This mechanism prevents unconsidered modification of parameters which may lead to system inconsistency and disfunctionment so don't change this unless you really know what you do.
<p>
At the bottom of the screen, the "Apply" button valids your changes on the screen by saviing this configuration to a file, note that this configuration isn't taken into account unless you save it and that when it is saved, it will be used in all futur sessions (until you change the configuration again).
<p>
If the configuration is saved without error, a success message appears on the screen.
